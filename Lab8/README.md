Overview :
    We will cover visudo and how to edit the sudoers file, what the format is for sudoers in the file, and then we will create a new user and group and start with our user outside of sudo, and then add the new group to sudoers file and then see what happens.

    We will also discuss the NOPASSWD option in sudoers and how this can be a large security risk if left in production systems.
